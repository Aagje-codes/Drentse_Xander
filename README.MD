Getting the Dutch iOS Synthesized Speech voice Xander to sound as if he is from Drenthe. 

Feed it a regular Dutch sentence and hear the difference. 

Example:

sent = "Er staat een paard in de wei"
instant_Drents(sent)

Not perfect, Xander still sounds very properly Dutch. 

* Note: This was a personal exercise to practise using Regular Expressions and the iOS Speech Synthesized voices. This is in no way meant to be disparage towards people from Drenthe or the Drents dialect.*
